## 1. Execution Plan
**Goal**: Investigate and address the drop in ROAS for Facebook Ads.

- Calculate ROAS, CTR, and Spend for each day, ad campaign, and audience segment. Identify the magnitude and timing of the ROAS drop. (Data Agent)
- Analyze the calculated metrics to identify potential causes for the ROAS drop. Look for patterns in spend, CTR, and audience performance. Formulate hypotheses about the cause of the drop (e.g., increased competition, ad fatigue, targeting issues). (Insight Agent)
- Evaluate the hypotheses generated in the previous step. For example, if ad fatigue is suspected, check CTR trends. If increased competition is suspected, analyze spend and impression data. If targeting issues are suspected, analyze audience performance. (Evaluator Agent)
- If ad fatigue is identified as a significant factor, generate new ad copy and headlines for the underperforming campaigns. (Creative Agent)
